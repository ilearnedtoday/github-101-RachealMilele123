# INTRODUCTION

## THIS IS WHAT I HAVE LEARNT :books:
* In this course overview üöÄ, i have learnt somethings about **Git** and **Github**üî•. 

* I have learnt the terms in [Github](https://github.com/), and how you can engage yourself with **GitHub community**.

* I have also learnt the difference bettween Git and Github, and their difference can shortly be said that, Git is a **Version control system** or rather it is a tool that is used to track, collaborate and share your codes, whereas Github is a web-platform that hosts and manages Git repositories.

* There are also terms that we use in Github; **repositories, branches, pull requests, forks, issues, Profiles, READMEs, and also Markdown files** and how you can create and use them.

   **TERMS/CONCEPTS IN GITHUB**
  ### REPOSITORIES
   * A Repository also known as a **repo** is a workspace for all your projects, and stored in the cloud‚òÅ they contain all your project files, codes and history. In a repository you can invite and collaboarate with different people.
   * A repository also contains a **README** file, this is where you tell others about your project, how and why it is useful and what to do withit.
  ### BRANCHES 
   * When you don not want to merge your project yet, you use the brance to isolate your work.
   * With this, you can be able to develop features, and fix bugs. 

  ### FORKS
   * This allows you to make chhanges in someone's project without affecting their original project.

  ### PULL REQUEST
   * You can use the pul requests to tell others about the changes make on their project and ask for their feedback.
  ### ISSUES
   * This is simply used to track bugs you have found and it can also be used to tell an open source about a bug you have found or feature you can add.
 
  ### PROFILE
     * This is where you tell people about yourself, what your are interested in and contributions you have made with your profile README.

* I have also learnt about **committing and pushing**, where you can add changes to your project.
### I am still a little confused on the  **Clonning** part.
 
##Learning this has really helped me with knowing something about Github, its terms, how to use them and so on.
 My goal is to continue learning more and exploring more things on Github.

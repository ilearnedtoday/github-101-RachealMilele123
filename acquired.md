# INTRODUCTION

## THIS IS WHAT I HAVE LEARNT :books:
* In this course overview üöÄ, i have learnt somethings about **Git** and **Github**üî•. 

* I have learnt the terms in [Github](https://github.com/), and how you can engage yourself with **GitHub community**.

* I have also learnt the difference bettween Git and Github, and their difference can shortly be said that, Git is a **Version control system** or rather it is a tool that is used to track, collaborate and share your codes, whereas Github is a web-platform that hosts and manages Git repositories.

* There are also terms that we use in Github; **repositories, branches, pull requests, forks, issues, Profiles, READMEs, and also Markdown files** and how you can create and use them.

   **TERMS/CONCEPTS IN GITHUB**
  ### REPOSITORIES
   * A Repository also known as a **repo** is a workspace for all your projects, and stored in the cloud‚òÅ they contain all your project files, codes and history. In a repository you can invite and collaboarate with different people.
   * A repository also contains a **README** file, this is where you tell others about your project, how and why it is useful and what to do withit.
  ### BRANCHES 
   * When you don not want to merge your project yet, you use the brance to isolate your work.
   * With this, you can be able to develop features, and fix bugs. 

  ### FORKS
   * This allows you to make chhanges in someone's project without affecting their original project.
